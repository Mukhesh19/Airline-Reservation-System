I developed this simple website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and was created as part of a project at Northwood University. You can view the website here. https://mukhesh19.github.io/Airline-Reservation-System/index.html

The primary objective of this project is to design and implement a functional database-driven system for airline reservations. The system allows users to conveniently check flight details, as well as book and cancel flight tickets. By streamlining these processes, the platform enhances the overall efficiency and user experience for passengers.
